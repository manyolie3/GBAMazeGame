*** Hello! ***

* This game has a maze like structure that requires you to get 
the character (Alice) to the end where her house is without 
colliding with any of the walls!

* Alice will collect coins on her way to the end of the maze.
She can collect up to 9! The total amount of coins you help her collect
will be shown on the end screen ONLY if you win.

*** How to play ***
1. Press enter to begin the game from the opening screen.
2. Use the left, right, up, and down arrow keys to move Alice.
3. Navigate through the maze without touching the walls.
    --> if you touch the wall at ANY point before reaching the house, you lose.
4. Collect coins throughout the maze by simply running into them, they 
will disppear once you have collected them and the number of coins you have 
collected will update at the top of the screen.
5. Be sure to get Alice to her house before the 45 second timer is up. 
If you fail to do so, you will lose the game and all of Alice's coins.
6. Once you have reached the top of the maze, guide Alice so that she collides
with the house, and you win!

how many coins you collected.

for the game to reset and take you back to the opening screen.
