Maze Runner - GBA Game

Hello!

	•	This game has a maze-like structure that requires you to guide the character, Alice, to the end, where her house is, without colliding with any of the walls!
	•	Alice will collect coins on her way to the end of the maze. She can collect up to 9! The total amount of coins you help her collect will be shown on the end screen ONLY if you win.

How to Play

	1.	Press Enter to begin the game from the opening screen.
	2.	Use the left, right, up, and down arrow keys to move Alice.
	3.	Navigate through the maze without touching the walls.
	•	If you touch the wall at ANY point before reaching the house, you lose.
	4.	Collect coins throughout the maze by simply running into them. They will disappear once collected, and the number of coins you’ve collected will update at the top of the screen.
	5.	Make sure to get Alice to her house before the 45-second timer is up. If you fail to do so, you will lose the game, and all of Alice’s coins will be lost.
	6.	Once you have reached the top of the maze, guide Alice so that she collides with the house, and you win!
	7.	If you win, the ending screen will read “You won!” and tell you how many coins you got in total.
	8.	If you lose, your ending screen will read “You lost”, and you will NOT see how many coins you collected.
	9.	If you wish to play again, from either screen, you may press Backspace to reset the game and return to the opening screen.
