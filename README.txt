Hello! 

* This game has a maze like structure that requires you to get 
the character (Alice) to the end where her house is without 
colliding with any of the walls!

* Alice will also collect coins on her way to the end of the maze.
While she will collect at least 3 coins because they are in her path,
she can collect up to 9! The total amount of coins you help her collect
will be shown on the end screen ONLY if you win.
